I am Ayén Bonsoa web developer keen on new technologies and passionate about adventure. I am Togolese, born in Lomé the capital, but originally from Niamtougou a city located in the north of the country. “Honor or dishonor is not in the sword, but in the hand that grasps it” - is the motto of the samurai. I am convinced that we are individually responsible for our actions, we forge our journey through our choices that produce and our failures and our successes. I have chosen “blacksamouraii” as a nickname on my networks because I am first of all a black man and then I adhere to this Japanese philosophy of thinking (the bushidō) through the samouraii way of life, which I respect. .

As far as my professional background is concerned, I was trained in Networks & Telecommunications software engineering. I then had the chance to specialize in applied computing and web development. I have been pursuing a course in Data scientism for some time, following certain opportunities that were offered to me, I am currently working on a work-study program in this field. I am always excited to look into web development offers related to web 3.0.
