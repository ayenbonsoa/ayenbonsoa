Hello, I'm Ayén Bonsoa, a web developer with a passion for new technologies and adventure. I'm Togolese, born in the capital Lomé, but originally from Niamtougou, a town in the north of the country.  I'm convinced that we are individually responsible for our actions, that we forge our path through our choices, which produce both our failures and our successes. I trained in applied computer science with an option in Network and Telecommunications software engineering. I then had the opportunity to specialize in web development and web design, more specifically in the advanced working techniques that are common in the industry. I'm available and always enthusiastic to collaborate and study projects related to web development and much more.
